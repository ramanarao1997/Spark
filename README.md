# Spark
This repo contains the basics on how to use spark.
It has various examples showing the usage of different concepts in Spark.
These examples also span different libraries of Spark like Spark SQL, Spark MLLib using DataFrames and Structured Streaming.

# How to Run
Make sure you have installed Spark. All the examples can be run locally on your personal machine.
Open a conda environment and run "spark-submit filename.py" to execute a file.

Note:
Once you run the structuredStreaming.py file add new files (access-logs1.txt, access-logs2.txt) to the 'logs' directory as the code treats files from this directory as its input stream.
